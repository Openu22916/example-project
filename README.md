# Project's proposal
The main target of this project is to improve the requirments collect and managing process and turn it into an ordered process. I'm a 
software development team leader in the IDF, and there are many cystomers that use the system we develop - on a daily frequency. Also there 
are many types of users, therefore the requirements coming from a large spectrum of users and hence are diverse. The amount of requirements 
is huge, the users dosen't aware to the significance of want they ask for and dosen't submit their suggestions in an oreder manner. Morover 
because we are working on military system, sometomes the urgency of the reqirements is very high and we need to develop and send it 
quickly. Considering those constraints in this project I choose to define a process of defining an ordered manner to defining and managing 
the requirments and cerate tests specifications from them.
The projects goals are:
1.Systematic definition of system requirements. With a list of demands set for each module and system feature, preparing test specifications will be more comprehensive and detailed.
2.Managing all the reqiurments and connecting each one of them to development specification in the system.
3.Managing vesions of requirments and changes tracking ability.
4.Connect each and every bug to the related requirment.
